# Project-1

To run the code, open the terminal and type "cd frontend", and type "npm start". You may have to download some things like router nav.
I've been using router nav ever since I started using react, so I'd assume it would be okay to use it for this project. To open the backend, 
type "cd backend" and type "npm start". You may have to download some things in that node project also. Then obviously make sure you are connected to the 
database. Then you can just make a account in the registration page, sign in with the account, and interact with the app wep page.
